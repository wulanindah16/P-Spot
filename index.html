          <h3>About</h3>
          <p><strong>P-SPOT (Piezoelectric Site Prediction and Optimization Tool)</strong> is a geospatial-based
            technology designed to determine the most optimal locations for installing piezoelectric modules, which are
            devices
            that can convert pressure or vibrations from footsteps into electrical energy. This system utilizes
            GeoAI-powered artificial intelligence with Swarm Optimization algorithms to effectively analyze spatial
            factors such as pedestrian traffic intensity and surrounding environmental conditions, based on data-driven
            insights.</p>

          <p>P-SPOT was developed as a solution to the growing demand for clean energy amid the high dependence on
            fossil fuels. Through this innovative approach, mechanical energy generated from human footsteps can be
            transformed into sustainable and environmentally friendly electrical energy. The energy produced can be used
            for street lighting, charging stations, and small-scale electrical systems in urban areas. In this way,
            every human step becomes a tangible contribution to achieving energy efficiency, reducing carbon emissions,
            and creating smart, future-oriented cities.</p>

          <h3> What is Piezoelectric Technology?</h3>

          <p>Piezoelectric is a material that can generate electrical energy when subjected to pressure or vibration.
            When a person steps on a surface equipped with a piezoelectric module, the mechanical energy from each
            footstep is converted into electrical energy that can be continuously reused. Piezoelectric has the
            characteristic that greater pressure generates greater power.</p>

          <p>The working principle of piezoelectric technology is relatively simple. The pressure from footsteps causes
            a change in electrical charge within the crystal structure of the piezoelectric material. This change
            produces
            an unstable alternating current (AC), which is then directed to a rectifier circuit to be converted into a
            more stable direct current (DC). The generated electricity is stored in a battery or capacitor so it can be
            used for various low-power electronic devices.</p>

          <p>A single human step can generate up to 0.035 watts of electrical energy, enough to power a small LED light
            with just a few steps. When applied in areas with high pedestrian traffic, this technology can produce
            significant amounts of energy for street lighting or other simple electrical needs, while supporting the
            development of
            efficient, environmentally friendly, and sustainable clean energy innovations.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Piezoelectric technology enables the conversion of kinetic energy from human
                footsteps into clean electricity. Although a single step only generates up to 0.035 watts, when applied
                in an area with around 10,000 steps per day, the system can produce approximately 350 watts of energy
                daily, enough to power several LED lights. By utilizing energy that would otherwise be wasted, this
                technology helps reduce dependence on fossil fuels while supporting the diversification of
                environmentally friendly energy sources.</p>

                human activity without relying on fossil fuels. Based on GeoAI analysis, this technology has the
                potential to save around 4,731 grams of CO₂ per day in areas with high pedestrian traffic, demonstrating
                a tangible contribution to reducing emissions. It serves as a source of green and eco-friendly energy
